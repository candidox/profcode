<strong>If you get to hear me now</strong>
<strong>I know you'll get stronger</strong><br>
<strong>When you get older</strong><br>
<strong>Just don't shrug your shoulders</strong><br>
<strong>When you get older</strong><br><br>
<strong>Things aren't easy</strong><br>
<strong>So just you believe me now</strong><br>
<strong>If you don't keep it cool now</strong><br>
<strong>You'll never make a sound</strong><br><br>
<strong>All the lights will guide the way</strong><br>
<strong>If you get to hear me now</strong><br>
<strong>All the fears will fade away</strong><br>
<strong>If you get to hear me now</strong><br><br>
<strong>If you get to hear me now</strong><br><br>
<strong>If you get to hear me now</strong><br>
<strong>Leave excuses aside</strong><br>
<strong>Speak out your mind</strong><br>
<strong>Don't let in slide</strong><br><br>
<strong>You're not always right</strong><br>
<strong>Things aren't easy</strong><br>
<strong>So just you believe me now</strong><br>
<strong>Don't learn the hard way</strong><br><br>
<strong>Just let me show you how</strong><br>
<strong>All the lights will guide the way</strong><br>
<strong>If you get to hear me now</strong><br>
<strong>All the fears will fade away</strong><br>
<strong>If you get to hear me now</strong><br>
<strong>If you get to hear me now</strong><br>
<strong>If you get to hear me now</strong><br>
<strong>If you get to hear me now</strong><br>
<strong>If you get to hear me now</strong><br>

    <h3>Complicated (Dimitri Vegas e Like Mike)</h3>

<br>
<strong>Pour another drink, I don't wanna think</strong><br>
<strong>Oh, it's been a long day</strong><br>
<strong>Get out of your head, smoking on my bed</strong><br>
<strong>Put that song on replay</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Don't worry now, look what we found</strong><br>
<strong>We don't have to go all-in</strong><br>
<strong>Head in the clouds, both looking down</strong><br>
<strong>Doesn't mean that we're falling, oh</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>We can keep it simple, baby</strong><br>
<strong>Let's not make it complicated</strong><br>
<strong>Labels are so overrated</strong><br>
<strong>Let's not make it complicated</strong><br>
<strong>Rules are meant for breaking, baby</strong><br>
<strong>Let's not make it complicated</strong><br>
<strong>Why don't we just go get naked?</strong><br>
<strong>Let's not make it complicated<strong></strong><br>
<strong>Let's not make it complicated</strong><br>
<strong>Let's not make it complicated</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Skinny dip at night, I can see your eyes</strong><br>
<strong>Searchin' through the shadows</strong><br>
<strong>You don't have to fight, I'll let you decide</strong><br>
<strong>I can help you let go</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Don't worry now, look what we found</strong><br>
<strong>We don't have to go all-in</strong><br>
<strong>Head in the clouds, both looking down</strong><br>
